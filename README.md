# Environmental Indicators for Central America using Google Earth Engine
---

The reporsitory contains source codes, and materials for preparing environmental variables using GEE



### Environmental variables prepared are:

    a) Agricultural Change
    b) Climate Change
    c) Drought
    d) Water Scarcity
    e) Deforerstation
    f) Population
    g) Night Time Light
    h) Land use land cover

### Countries shapefiles, for which Env. variables are prepared are:

1. [Belize (BLZ)](resources\adm0_shapefiles\Belize_BLZ)
2. [Costa Rica (CRI)](resources\adm0_shapefiles\CostaRica_CRI)
3. [Dominican Republic (DOM)](resources\adm0_shapefiles\DominicanRepublic_DOM)
4. [EL Salvador (SLV)](resources\adm0_shapefiles\ElSalvador_SLV)
5. [Guatemala (GTM)](resources\adm0_shapefiles\Guatemala_GTM)
6. [Haiti (HTI)](resources\adm0_shapefiles\Haiti_HTI)
7. [Honduras (HND)](resources\adm0_shapefiles\Honduras_HND)
8. [Mexico (MEX)](resources\adm0_shapefiles\Mexico_MEX)
9. [Nicargua (NIC)](resources\adm0_shapefiles\Nicaragua_NIC)
10. [Panama (PAN)](resources\adm0_shapefiles\Panama_PAN)

## Deatils of Environmental Variables used in this project:

     a) Agricultural Change

- **Name:** UN FAO Drained Organic Soils Area (Annual)
- **Availability timeperiod:** 1992-2017
- **Resolution:** 927.67m
- **Band used:** cropland
- **Dataset link:** https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/FAO_GHG_1_DROSA_A
- **GEE Code:** 

**Description:** 

Organic soils develop in wet soil ecosystems. They include tropical and boreal peatlands, high-latitude bogs, ferns, and mires. 
Organic soils cover globally a mere 3 percent of the terrestrial land area but represent up to 30 percent of the total soil carbon, thus playing an important role in maintaining the earthâ€™s carbon balance. 
Agriculture is a major cause of drainage of organic soils around the world. Drainage exposes to aerobic conditions the organic matter of organic soils that oxidizes releasing large amounts of harmful greenhouse gases (GHG) to the atmosphere. DROSA-A and DROSE-A are the basis for country and regional statistics on drained organic soils disseminated in three FAOSTAT datasets (Cultivation of Organic Soils; Cropland; and Grassland).
